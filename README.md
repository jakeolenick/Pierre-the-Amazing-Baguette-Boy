# Pierre-the-Amazing-Baguette-Boy
A repository for my final project from the first term of my Sophomore year of high school. Requires Netlogo.

This is a repository for the final project I made in the first term of my Sophomore year of high school. This was a solo project. It is in Netlogo, which is a programming language based in turn on Java.

Gameplay is simple: explore the map; shoot baguettes to defeat enemies; avoid being hit by enemies; defeat the final boss. It is a bit like the original Legend of Zelda, except that the only weapon is the bow and arrow (i.e. baguettes). It comes with music.
